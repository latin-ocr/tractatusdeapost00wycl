INTRODUCTION. IX

religion to which he belongs, incur apostasy. Both these propositions
seem intended to bring over to Wyclif's band of ‘poor priests' some
wavering Franciscans or Dominicans, who, struck and attracted by
his austere doctrines, were yet held back for fear of apostasy. This
hypothesis is strengthened, first, by the comparative moderatior] in
tone to which Wyclif keeps all through the book, second, by several
passages that we shall notice as we go on, and third, by the general
tendency and evident ὰ propos of the arguments. 1

Preliminary Questz'on: Whether the habit is essential to religion
(pp. 3—9). Ι. Whether ‘religious’ life is better than ordinary Christi-
anity (pp. 9—13>; Il. Whether it would not be better for those
Orders not to exist (pp. 13-16), and III. Whether perpetual vows
are expedient (p. 16—19).

Preliminary Question. The Decretal treats as apostates those
who put off the habit3 orders that are distinct, though professing
the same rule, can be distinguished only by the habit; and to practise
the contrary doctrine would produce confusion. But, on the other
hand, religion is in the soul; apostasy cannot depend upon bodily
clothing3 if it could, any change in the habit would (an absurd
consequence) produce a correspondiug change in religion3 and were
the habit essential, even the Pope could not grant a dispensation. It is
therefore not 80, but only the external characteristic by which the
Orders are known to differ. What distinguishes thern is their ob-
ligations, e. g. to wear certain clothes. So far, Wyclif is quite
orthodox3 but his corollary‚ viz. that anyone may, without permission
or dispensation, set aside the habit of his Order, is not. The Pope has
no power granted him for evil; but it is manifestly evil to punish a man
for having laid aside a mere sign. ‘Andyet, some are called apostates,
who have done 50, in order to live more piously in a more devout
communizyff He goes on to complain loudly of their imprisonrnent
as illegal, encroaching upon kingly rights, and contrary to the Christian
law. From some passages in De Blasplzemz'a it appears that Wyclif’s
propaganda amongst the monks was very active at this time, he avails

¹ This of course was not Wyclif's only· intention in writing the first two

chapters; but it seems probable that the idea was in his mind, and influenced him
to some extent.
