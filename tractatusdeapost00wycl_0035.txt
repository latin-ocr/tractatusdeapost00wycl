INTRODUCTION. XXXI

Ch. XI. We here come to another attack upon ‘absolute acci-
dents’3 here again consisting mainly of repetitions, The idea of an
accident able to exist apart from its substance destroys the very nature
of the term accident. Wyclif takes one meaning of the word, and will
not allow that they can give another to ir. In any case, he says, you
have to posit extension, which cannot exist by itself; what is the use
then of imagining besides a quantity that can do so? Quantity is but
the ‘being so great' of a substance (132-134). And if neither
substantia] form nor primal matter can exist alone, how can that which
depends upon them do so? Abstract quality must exist in a subject,
or be infinite, like the attributes of God (pp. 134—136). Names should
be given to all things according to their qualities3 if these accidents
have all the qualities of bread, they should be called so. The arguments
borrowed from the peculiar nature of quality, those against a vacuum,
and those combating annihilation follow, rather more fully developed
than before, but on the same plan (pp. 136—146). He closes by
denouncing the pride of those who exalt themselves, under colour
of magnifying God’s omnipotence‚ and the fallacy of this assertion:
The Pope admits transsubstantiation: therefore absolute accidents
exist (pp. 146-150).

Ch. XII. This chapter examines the different theories concerning
the accidents supposed to remain in the Host. Some take it to be
quantity (pp. 151—159); some, a congeries of different accidents
(p. 159 to the end of the chapter); and some, quality (ch. XIII). —
Quantity must have a subject. It is separable from its subject, more
or less, Now even inseparable accidents, such as the power of laughing
in man (an instance taken from Aristotle) are not conceivable without
a subject. The Sacrament is active, which quantity is not. Existing
in the concrete, quantity can be neither increased nor diminished3 a
number, if increased, is another number by the very fact. Now we
see that quantity is increased in the Sacrament. The Nominalists
change both religion and the laws of Nature3 they would make all
things infinitely great, quantity extended within quantity ad infinitum‚·
and the absurd hypothesis of ‘compressed quantity' cannot save them.—
It is still more absurd to call the Eucharist an aggregate of
accidents3 every reason that makes against one, makes against the
whole aggregate. A collective entity is no entity at all; the Fathers
