the Friars that follows, there is nothing calculated to destroy the
effect which the previous chapter may have produced upon the
waverer53 on the contrary, the thesis that apostasy is often, nay,
almost always incurred within the convent-walls, must have acted in
a very different way. This idea is developed somewhat in the form
of a sermon or homily, with remarks, explanations and amplifications
of the Scripture text (Prov. VI, 12—14): 1St Homo apostata, vir
inutilis (pp. 20—24); 2¹³⁶l graditur ore perverso (pp. 24—28); 3¹'d an-
nuit oculis (pp. 28—31)·, 41¹¹ terit pede (pp. 31—35)·, 5th digito loquitur
(pp. 35—39); 6⁸¹ pravo corde machinatur malum (pp. 39—43);
’γὼ et omni tempore jurgia seminat (pp. 43-45).

Ist Homo apostata, vir inutilis. Uselessness and sins of omission,
are the first marks of backsliding. The great omission that Wyclif
cannot forgive the Friars is, that they refused to join with him in
the war against Church possessions. They were instituted only to
renew the life of the Apostles, in strict poverty; to that mission
they ought to be faithful. lt is a work of spiritual mercy, far more
important than deeds of charity done to the body, yet Christ con-
demns those who omit the latter. Worse traitors than Judas, they
betray Christ glorffied, Christ, who came but to bear witness to
the truth. — The fact is, Wyclif is so positive that the Church
should not hold property, that he cannot understand how a body of
men, poor in theory, can resuse to think as he does without being
false to their own principles. He pictures them bringing forward a
few miserably weak excuses, “Time, place, circumstances, do not
allow thern to speak. “But'', he replies, with a burst of eloquence,
“N OW is the right time; the Prince of this world has spread his
armies throughout the whole universe, and the King of kings has
promised to assist His Church even unto the end of the world. And
John the Baptist and so many martyrs have striven in this cause,
knowing that Truth overcometh all things. Then let a Christian
excuse himself how he vvill; before Him that shall try the heart and
the reins at the Last Judgment, this negligence and idleness will
find no excuse.’⁷

He deals in the same manner with all the other excuses, very
poor ones indeed. “No more remains to be done, since there are
now no enemies of the Church3 bishops should not be attacked3 if
