XX INTRODUCTION.

can be predicated. In the external world, the contrary takes place.
Animal is really and formally as many different animals as there are
individuals A, Β, C . . . Z3 and it is only fundamentally and potentially1
one, in so far as it gives a foundation by means of which, and the
mind’s abstractive power, it can become one. This, the reader may
note, is not very far from Conceptualism, as expressed by some of
its ablest exponents.

Now, this was not sufficient for the Ultra-Realists. They contended
hat the Universal existed in the world of things in the same way
as it did in the world of ideas. Of course there were many different
varieties, school within school3 Prantl says there were as many as
thirteen shades of Realism. Some went very far. David of Dinant
admitted the identity of God with matter and spirit, “because, if
not identical‚ there would be a Universal Entity wider than all, which
would be above God, as embracing both matter, Spirit, and God''.
“Guillaume of Champeaux taught''‚ says Abelard, “that the same thing
Ι or substance was present in its entirety and essence in each individual,
and that individuals differed no whit in their essence, but only in
the variety of their accidents''.2 They seem to have made of the world
a bundle of universal qualities‚ of which the presence in some things,
combined with their absence in others, creates all the differences that
individuate material and immaterial existences. Imay not have under-
stood them properly; but if I do, their world was c'omposed of
Universals much as the chemist⁷s material world is made up of
elements; with this difference, however, that the oxygen in a given
drop of water and in a given specimen of marble are only absolutely
similar, not identically the same. And then, there would be the

in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the slightest mention of this distinction which is of
supreme importance, as may easily be seen. All those distinctions between univer-
salia ante rem, in re, and post rem are secondary. The great question which the
opposite Schools had to answer was this: How can the same word, applied to
different individuals, mean tlze same thing? Nominalists answer: It means the same
thing i. e. the same worck· Conceptualists say; It means the same thing, i. e. the
same idea Realists are forced (and 1 believe rightly) to say: It means the same
thing, i. e. the same object of the idea.
