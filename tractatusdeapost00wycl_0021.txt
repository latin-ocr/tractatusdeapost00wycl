INTRODU CTION. XVII

2¹¹d That of Scotus, to whom the theory of absolute accidents,
as above set forth, is to be ascribed. (Cf. Migne‚ Dict. de Th. Scolastique,
art. Substance et accident.)

3sd That of Descartes, and in general the theory that ascribes a
certain outward movement, resistance‚ δια, in the place where the
bread waS, due to supernatural agency.

41¹¹ The theory of intentional (or imaginary) accidents, that have
nothing corresponding in the external world, and are purely subjective3
which is exposed to the double inconvenience of making all our senses
lie by Divine agency, and of taking no account of the belief that the
appearances remaining are something really objective.

With regard to these theories, we must remark that most of
Wyclif's arguments are merely directed against absolute accidents and
the theory oquuinas3 some, however, go further, as when he says that,
bread being called bread only on account of its sensible appearances,
if these remain, the name cannot rightly be changed. This is almost
a foreshadowing of a modern philosophical school. Lewes, in his
Problems of Metaphysz'cs, says very decidedly, “A thing is its qualities'’;
which amounts to the very same.¹

I may now begin to examine Wyclif's Eucharistic doctrine.

As the result, he says, of the general apostasy in this second
millenary after Christ, Satan being loosed, dreadful heresies concerning
the Eucharist have crept into the Church. The theory which affirms
the destruction of the substance of bread and wine² is opposed to
the words of the Church services and hymns, to St. Paul, the Acts
of the Apostles, and to the Gospels themselves. We ought to stand by
Scripture3 what Scripture, in six different places, declares to be bread, is
bread. It is never called an accident, at any rate, as these lying masters
say. If we begin to wrest words from their right sense, our faith will
soon be perverted3 for if the Pope has a right to do it in this case,
why not in all others? Tradition too speaks likewise: Augustine,

1 Though at present unable to identify the quotation, I am quite sure that it

is in the work mentioned.
2 We have already seen that St. Thomas formally denies annihilation, though

in a very inexplicable way3 it would therefore seem that W'yclif’s opponente, either
unawares or driven by the force of argument, had actually admitted it; the more
so, as Wyclif alludes to this very often and very energetically.
