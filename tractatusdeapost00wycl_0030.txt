XXVI INTRODUCTION.

Antichrist and his accomplices) have led it astray from Christ
(pp. 76—78). It has often been remarked by editors of Wyclif, that
“Gog'', “Magog'', “Antichrist'', “satraps'' are merely general expressions
used by him to denote any persons following tendencies which he
considers to be deleterious to the Church, and especially those who
happened to be their chief exponents. But I do not know whether
the influence of his general philosophical position on this view has
been much noticed. As an ultra-realist, Wyclif was bound to call
Antichrist any man who concentrated in himself the most of the
Universal, “Antichristianism'', which, we must never forget, was a
non-entity, existing in its subjects as a defect. This explains how
Wyclif, though he often personifies that non-entity in a vague manner,
never thinks of attaching it to any particular institution, as, ν. g.
some Protestants, calling the Popes Antichrists, and admitting that
individual Popes may be good men, are bound to admit that ‘some
Antichrists may be saved’; a most astounding conclusion, from which
Wyclif’s principle “In so far as any man is contrary to Christ, in
so far is he Antichrist'', always saved him. This may also explain
why he never falls into those personalities in which Luther so
frequently indulges, and why the names of the lower animals, coupled
with those of his opponents, never degrade his pen.¹ To him, the
Universal, as real as each particular personal entity, is far more
important on account of its wide spreading influence for good or for
evil. It is a curious fact that Luther, so remarkable in an opposite
way, is said by Melanchthon to have even during his monastic life
preferred the Nominalist Occam to all other doctors.

The chapter ends with a short discussion about a particular
theory which, so far as I am aware, never had any great notoriety,
and which Wyclif easily proves to be self-contradictory. It holds that
the bread and wine remain after consecration, but not in their nature,
they become an accident. But, Wyclif argues, if it is admitted that
the white colour which they see is bread, then the nature of bread
must remain. And if the bread is the Body of Christ, it is no longer
an accident, if not Christ's Body, we fall into the error of Berengarius.

¹ Not that he had no talent of invective. His opponents in this very volume
are treated in general as wild geese, magpies, mad dogs (28, 42, 82).
