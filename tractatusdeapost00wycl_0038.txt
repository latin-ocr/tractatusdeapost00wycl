XXXIV INTRODUCTION .

substantially, corporassy, or identically that bread'' ..... If the reader
has followed the explanation here given, Ι think he will see that in
these words there is no contradiction; they are merely the outcome of
Wyclif⁷s philosophical position. At the bottom of the same page he even
admits in a certain sense that Christ is Substantialgr present, i. e., as
a substance. (20) Augustine is either inconsistent or must be explained:
besides, the work quoted may spurious. (21) Gregory can also be
understood in Wyclif⁷s sense. As for (22, 23) [gnatius and Dionysius,
they never mention accidents at all. If to these we add St. Paul,
we have a second dozen of testimonies; and to crown all, Christ’s
words (pp. 213—217). But even the agreement of all the Fathers
would amount to no more than probability, being only testimonial
evidence; and they disagree (pp. 217—222). ssut how can we say that
Christ’s body is present just as in the CrucifiX‚ z'n signo? Wyclif
replies: Christ's Body, though only present in signO, is present otherwise
than ut in signo (p. 223). Ι confess that this last distinction has
puzzled me much. It seems to admit another sort oi existence of

· Christ's Body in the Host‚ besides the ‘sign existence'. And then

Wyclif would perhaps be no more than an ordinary orthodox believes,
who chooses to call by the name ‘substance of bread' its visible and
tangible appearance& But this again would clash with his Realistic
theory. On the other hand, I arn not inclined to think that he would
take refuge in a mere verbal evasion ol the question, though the
whole of the book seems to point to that conclusion. This distinction
seems hopelessly inconsistent with his former utterances. He goes on
to say: Bread is not united to Christ⁷s Body in the unity of one
Person, but as nearly as possible to that union (p. 224). If I at all
understand his theory, it runs thus: Every sign receives a certain
figurative entity of the thing it signifies, and in proportion as the
sign proceeds from a higher authority, this entity becomes more
perfectly present. Our fancy may consider a lamb as the image of
Christ, and it then is Christ — to a certain extent. But the Paschal
lamb was much rnore so3 and the highest possible perfection was
reached, when Christ said of the bread: This is my Body. Thus I
understand it: but then, ISt, the difference would be only one of
degree, not of kind: how then can Wyclif say: est tamen ibi aliter
quam ut in signo? And 2⁰⁶¹, the authority of Christ would suffice,
