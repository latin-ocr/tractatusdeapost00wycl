INTRODUCTlON. XXIX

would be infinitely intensified. 3sd Negative qualities would be also
infinite; V. g., the Sacrament would be infinitely dense and rare at
the same time. 41¹¹ Men could be put, however distant from each
other, into instantaneous communication. 51¹¹ The whole world, vwere it
thus transsubstantiated, could be held in a man's hand; which is
blasphemy. ὅῑὴ The meanest of things would become God. (This wanders
from the present question, being an attack on the accident—theory.)
711² Why should the Sacrament possess only dimensional quantity?
Why not the other sorts: time, place, &C.? And if these are also
miraculously preserved, it is no longer an entity, but a collection of
incongruous entities. 8ἰὴ If the absolute accidents, v, g. of a man
and a woman, should beget a son, and that sinfully‚ yet they could
not sin; they might be damned‚ and yet cannot suffer3 nor can they
beget. oth A subdeacon‚ if he had power to transsubstantiate bread
into the world, while a priest could transsubstantiare it only into
Christ's ssody, would be higher than the priest. 10th As the world
essentially depends on the whole of its matter, a priest could not
celebrate Mass without destroying the world3 for he would destroy
the substance of bread. ¹ 11th A vacuum, abhorred by Nature, would
be possible in the Host, where there is nothing present but quantity.
12th Is contrary qualities can belong to the same thing in different
places, a man, bilocated — existing at the same time in England and
in India — might be living in England and dead in India.

Ch. IX. How then is Christ present in the Host? As the thing
signified is present in the sign3 the golden calf was a calf only
figuratively‚ but this figurative entity was present in every part of
the gold. So too of the brazen serpent; so too of the angels that
represented the Trinity to Abraham; each of these types had its own
separate and physica] existence. The Sacrament is thus of a double
nature, earthly and diviue3 not identically Christ's Body, though
really so, our Lord's words being true. Thus there is but one Body‚
Christ's‚ as principally to be thought of. Its terrestrial nature is
forgotten7 absorbed by faith3 yet we must not suppose that He is

¹ Annihilafion, we may here observe‚ is still more repugnant to Realists than
to other philosophers‚ For7 material essence being in all things absolutely identical‚
the smallest amount of matter destroyed implies the destruction of all matter.
