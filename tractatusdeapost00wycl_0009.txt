De Apostasia, De Blasfemia, and the side-notes, are all in the same

ssohemian vtyess {yse buoh (God comfort theel) and after De Prophetia:
Neb gest toho dobrze hoden (for he is well worthy thereof).

D. A paper MS.; small 4103 belongs to the University Library,
Prague. Same contents as C; probably a copy from it, made a few
years later. Handwriting much inferior, with many mistakes. Two
