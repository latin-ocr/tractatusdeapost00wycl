universal Metalloid present wherever there was oxygen‚ and in many
compounds where oxygen was not: and so on. Wyclif admits this
identity3 at least generic identity, as he calls it. A man and a horse
were indeed specifically distinct from each other; but they were
generically identical‚ both having within them the element animal,
meaning tlze same thing in both. That our author upheld this doctrine,
even to the uttermost limits of making Being identical in all things,
appears from his De Ente Predicamentalz', now publishing, in which
he affirms that Being is a univocal term, i. e. means the same thing
in its individuals, like the other Universals. But if Being is the same
and identical in all things, how is difference possible? It will be
curious, when his philosophical works are published‚ to see how he
manages to escape that pantheism to which the first ultra-Realists
were driven. l-lis doctrine of the Eucharist is an evident deduction
from his Realism. Not to mention other points that will appear later,
everyone admitted that an aliquitas of the bread remained in the
Host; now this aliquitas, according to him, was identical with the
aliquitas of Christ's Body that supervened: so there must in every
case be a subject of the change, if it can be called a change. He
develops a similar argument very cleverly and at some length in an
account of a debate between himself and certain bishops, which I
have copied from De Blasphemia to point out his doctrine more
clearly3 in De Apostasia he only alludes to it by the way.

“These heretics are said to condemn as heretical two propositions
concerning the Eucharist . . . God moved a certain secular Catholic
doctor, that he should not consent but contradict their foolishness.
And he is said to have asked them if they intended to condemn
as heretical the Saints’ opinions respecting Universals ex parte rei,
from which their signs take their names according to logicians. But
they denied that. being ashamed. ssut he said: ‘From this it follows
that the substance of material bread remains in the consecrated Host.
l say that the genus substance is wherever any individual of the
genus is: But in the said Sacrament there is an individual of the
genus substance; for, as you yourselves affirm, Christ’s Body is there
bodily3 therefore the genus substance remains in the Host, and as
it is a substance (because it is the essence of every material substance)
it is thus bread. It follows that the substance of material bread
