INTRODUCTION. VII

De Apostasz'a, and De Fundacione Sectarum, a tract of 80 pages, were
both writing at the same time3 simultaneously appeared his tract
De Cruciata (44 pages). De Dissensione Paparum belongs to the same
time, though perhaps it is a little earlier, according to Dr Buddensieg.
De septem donis Spiritus Sancti (22 pp.) was written immediately
after De fundacione Sectarum, between July and October, 1383;
without mentioning several other short works, written either in the
spring or in the autumn of the same year. Few men have worked
so much as Wyclif; for this outpour was not limited to one year
or to one period only, it embraces the whole of the man's career.

This work itself possesses peculias interest, on account of the
great length at which Wyclif discusses the doctrine of Transsub-
stantiation. It is by no means easy at first sight to perceive his exact
position, especially when we see him adhering with great energy to
the condemnation of Berengarius, ancl not only asserting the real
presence of Christ in the Host‚ but even using the very word trans-
substantiation (p. 58, 1. 17, and elsewhere); while at the same time
he asserts that the substance of bread remains, denies impanation,
and says that Christ is present only in figure. But, though Ι cannot
deny that Wyclif, like every man who ventures on so vast a task
as framing a scheme of religion for himself, often is and must be
inconsistent, yet Ι think that the careful study of De Apostasia will
clear away most of the seeming contradictions to which Ι have just
alluded, and show how what is contradictory to υς, is not so to him.

To understand it completely, we ought to possess the light of
his philosophical works, which have not yet been published. We all
know that he was a Realist, and this fact bears an important part
in the explanation of his system; but how far he ventured beyond
the very moderate Realism of Aquinas, or the system, hardly less
cautiously reserved, of his Franciscan rival, Scotus, remains yet to
be ascertained. From this point of view, we might regret that the
philosophical works of Wyclif were not published first, but it was
evidently impracticable to delay the appearance of his best known
works until the long series of his forgotten books on scholastic
philosophy was exhausted.

In proceeding to give an analysis of De Apostasia, Ι ought to
point out that the work cannot properly. be said to have a plan, in
