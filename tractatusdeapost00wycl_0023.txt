INTRODUCTION. XIX

Ι think, to point out that the Catholic Church really considers as idolatry
the worship of the accidents as such;1 and Aquinas (S. Th. 3a pars,
qu. 76, art. 7) absolutely denies that Christ’s Body can be seen in
the sacrament by any bodily eye, even that of a glorified saint. If
Wyclif only meant that, and chose to call the Host, as the Fathers
often do, by the name of bread — merely asserting Christ’s invisible
presence, and saying that what appeared was not Christ, not to be
adored, and only the sign of his presence, he could say all that, and
yet remain orthodox. In De Blasplzemia (yet unpublished, but of
which I have had the advantage of seeing the MS.) Wyclif inveighs
with just reason against those priests who let the people believe that
their bodily eyes, seeing the Host, saw Christ, because this erroneous
belief contributed, as they thought, to increase devotion, although it
could not be reasonably maintained. ssut it may be as well to point
out that the sentence: “What you see is bread'’, may be emphasized
either thus: “What you see is bread”; or thus: “What you see is
bread’⁷·, and it was certainlyin the second way that Wyclif emphasized it.

Here, in order to understand better the strength or the weakness
of our author's position, a short synopsis of the whole system of
Realistic Philosophy is necessary. When we have a universal idea, as
of man or of animal in general, the object of our thought is also
universal: one, though existing z'n many individuals. This, denied by
Nominalists and Conceptualists, was affirmed by the whole school of
Realistic philosophers. But they split into moderate Realists and
ultra-Realists. The former, with Aquinas and Scotus at their head2'
asserted that the One in Many, as in the external world, and the
One in many, as in our thought, exist in two absolutely contrary
ways. For instance, in our mind, animal is really and formally one,
only fundamentally and potentially does it exist in many, i. e. when
our mind applies it to all the individuals A, B, C . . . Z, of which it

¹ Ι happened once to corne across a French prayer-book in which there was
this expression: ces especes (species) ador-ables,- these adorable appearances. Of
course, we must allow for looseness and inexactitude in a mere book of piety; but
Ι feel convinced that, taken as they stand, these words might be condemned as
heretical.

2 Ι take no note here of the minor, yet considerable differences that separate

these two philosophers.
