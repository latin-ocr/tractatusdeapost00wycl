XXII INTRODUCTION.

remains in the consecrated Host. And because they knew not how
to remove this evidence, he sent them back as foolish men (De
Blasphemia, c. 16)''.

There would be many interesting questions connected with this
theory of Wyclif, but it seems preferable to examine them as we go
along, and continue the analysis for the present. -— The chapter, a
very short one, closes with two rather poor arguments, The sacrament
is round, white, heavy, διας therefore it is the subject of soundness, &c.
Evidently, only a logical subject is meant here. Still, Ens being
univocal in Wyclif's theory, whatever is logical is real too; so, from
his point of view, and his theory admitted, the argument may have
weight. Again: if the sacrament be the Body of Christ, and Christ's
Body be thus without a subject, it follows that no Christian ought
to be subject to Christ. Wyclif, feeling that many would set this
aside as an idle quibble, points out that St. Peter uses the word
subject in a sense relative to authority, and not as Aristotle uses it.
But this argument seems to use it in both senses, and therein the
fallacy would lie. He concludes by attacking the Friars with great
vehemence for not stamping out this heresy; which negligence proves
that they are either simoniacal heretics, or traitors of whom the land
must be purged.

Ch. V. This chapter and the following ones until the eighth,
are devoted to refuting the objections raised against Wyclif's theory,
Grosseteste’s authority, which is very great with Wyclif, probably on
account of his resistance to the Pope in a certain well-known case
of ecclesiastical discipline, is brought to bear against him. Here,
however, and in general, whenever an authority is quoted, the candid
reader will perhaps find that our author carries the liberty of explaining
away texts that are against him rather too far. When Grosseteste and
others affirm that the accidents exist per se in the Hosr‚ he adds,
“that is, in the act of our mind's contemplation’'; when they say
that the bread and wine disappear‚ he makes this to signify “disappear
from our mental vision''. There is really no reason why he should
not make his contemporary antagonists be also of the same mind as
he was3 for it is hard to conceive more expressive language than this.
The fact is that Wyclif is much displeased with the glosseS, of which
he often complains, on account of the explanations they give to many
