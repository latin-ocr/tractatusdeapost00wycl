XII INTRODUCTION.

the Friars exasperate those that have possessions‚ they will suffer
for it.''. .. And therefore, he concludes significantly (p. 24), the
religious and intelligent Friars break away from these apostates.

2ssd Graditur ore perverso. Sins of the tongue: lying, flattery‚
evil-speaking. Lying is dismissed with a few strong words; the
proverb: ‘A Friar has said thus and thus, so it is false', is quoted.
The flattery here attacked is the flattery of the public, by sermons
uttered to please, not to edify them. To relate fables and put human
traditions in the place of God's word, is the very worst kind of
flattery3 thereby they become spirits of error, demons, or rather, as
dead to the world7 corpses wandering about, moved by a demon.
They delight in repeating all evil they have heard3 which is a still
more grievous sin, if they are bound to silence.

3s⁶³ Annuit oculis. In a mystic sense, ‘the eye' meaning the
intention, to wink with the eye signifies to prefer private interest to
the public good3 for instance, when they entrap men, and especially
boys, into their Order. This is at any rate a sin against prudence3
for the persons thus influenced may have no call from God3 and thus,
though serving the order, they would harm the Church. Seeking our
private welfare, sin can hardly be avoided; and that is Why civil
ownership always savours of sin (p. 30). Here incidentally we see
a Socialistic conclusion that necessarily flows from Wyclf’s principles;
another appears still more clearly at the end of ch. 7.¹

41¹sl Terit pede. ‘The foot’ in Scripture signifies the affecfions,
which are perverted amongst the Friars, who love temporal things3
they beg clamomusly, continually‚ shamelessly‚ for rich communsties,
in order to waste the money3 and they refuse to share what they
have with their poorer brethren, who have more right to ask alms
of them than they of the people.

5ὡ Digito loquitur. ‘leefinger’ taken in its mystic sense, means
the power of acting. Three points in which the Friars go to excess:
1St Indulgences and absolutions. He who is contrite gets indulgence
from God by the very fact; indulgences can only be of use when
contrition exists already. 2¹1d They extol masses, penanceS, funerals,
and all functions that bring them money. 3sd They ‘make broad

² ‘To savour of sin' however, does not mean to be sinsul in Wyclif’s language.
