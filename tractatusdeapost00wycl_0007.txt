INTRODUCTION.

De Apostasia, which is now printed for the first time, has been
hitherto known to the public only by Shirley⁷s valuable catalogue
of Wyclif's works. His notice, however, is not without a few errors,
which ought to be corrected first of all, before I snake any further
remarks concerning the editing of the work, and the work itself.

lt runs thus: “De Apostasict. In two chapters. Incipit: Restat
ulterius ponere aliud principium. Desinit: fratrum commodum quoad
deum. —— MSS. Vienna: CCXCII, ff. 37—124; CCCX, ff. 49—128.
Univ. Prague: 111 F. ιι, ff. 70—1'343 Ill G. ιι, ff. 2080—220. Trin.
Coll. Dub.: C. 1, 24, pp. 293—310. -— The Prague MSS. seem both
to be imperfect. — Autlz. Author's name on the Vienna MSS.;
Walden, De Sam-amentis, passim3 Bale, title only.''

On p. 63, he quotes the Vienna catalogue: “Undecima‚ de
Apostasia‚ 18 capp. Restat . . . . in fine, lzoc venerabili sacramento''.

The corrections are as follows: There are ¹7 Chapters, not 2
nor 18; the second chapter ends with fratrum conmnodmn &C.; the
seventeenth, as in the Vienna catalogue. The Vienna MSS. are re-
spectively CCCXCll (or cod. 1343) and CCCCX (or cod. 3935).
There are three MSS. at Prague University, the one omitted here
being C. 73: only one of the three (111 G. ιι) is imperfect, ending
at about the middle of the second chapter. —— C. 1, 24, Tr. Coll. Dub.
is imperfect, breaking off at the ‘end of the second chapter. The
author's name is only in cod. CCCXC[1; in CCCCX, C. 73 and
ΙΙΙ F. 11. there are his initials.

For the sake of uniformity with the other works published by
the Wyclif Society, I have lettered these MSS. in the various readings.
Thus, cod. 1343 (or CCCXCII) will in future be A; this was the
MS. copied for the text of the work. Cod. 3935 (or CCCCX) is 133

— C.73 is C; ΙΙΙ F. 11 is D; III G. 11 is E, and Tr.Coll. Dub. C. ι, 24is F.
A.
