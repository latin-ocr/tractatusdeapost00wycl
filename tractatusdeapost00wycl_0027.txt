{NTRODUCTION XXIII

sentences that seem in his favour, thus turning them against him3
ancl he no doubt wishes to show that, to use a homely expression,
two can play at that game. Resides, his great contentiori is that
Scripture alone is to be followed, and that both the Pope and the
Fathers can mistake; so he is all the less scrupulous in explaining
their words. If the explanation be unsatisfactory, they mistake, and
that is all. — In the answer to the quotation of Grosseteste, we
find a clue to his doctrine of the existence, at once figurative and
real, of Christ's Body in the Host. After consecration‚ he says, we
think Christ's Body present, the bread having become the sign of
that presence. Time, the Universal, and the Sensible, have no actual
and real esse, except in so far as the mind knows them3 and so it
is of the esse of every sign, qua tale. And yet every sign, besides the
real esse that it acquires on becoming a sign, has also an independent
natural esse. Thus, the bread being the sign of Christ's Body is
Christ⁷s Body in reality, according to Wyclif’s system3 while, at the
same time it is mere bread from another point of view. Logically,
I suppose that Wyclif would admit that a statue has two entitie33
the one, as being of stone, &c., shaped in a certain fashion, the other,
as representing this or that person. St. Dionysius is also explained in
the same manner3 St. Ambrose likewise (pp. 62—65). Innocent III
may have declared that the accidents remain without a subJect3 but
besides his accustomed explanation of the sense (see above, for
Grosseteste), Wyclif points out: 1St that any other sense would imply
annihilation, which is inadmissible3 2⁰d that Innocent neither spoke
by inspiration, nor grounding his decision on Scripture; and that
therefore, 3¹‘d he may have been as wrong as when he levied a tribute
of 900 marks upon England.¹ Here Wyclif goes out of his way to
deplore the growing perversity of the times, the doctors that uphold
lying in Oxford, and the multiplicatiori of heretics who consent to
simony, concluding that Innocent’s decree went no farther than did
Nicolas' decision against Berengarius3 and that if it did, we ought to
respect it only in so far as it agrees with Scripture (pp. 65-68).
When, v, g. Innocent goes beyond Scripture to determine doctrines

1Wyclif often returns to those ‹ffoo marks, which evidently rankle in his
memory, as a good patriot. See p. 204, l. 20—23.
