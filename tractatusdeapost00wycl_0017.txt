their fringes' by letters of fraternity, admitting laymen into the
Order3 but this is concealed simony‚ being based on the tacit un-
derstanding that the lay Brother will help them with his money:
take that away, and their spiritual aid is withdrawn. But merit,
God⁷s grace, can be neither bought nor sold. And this has no
connection with the payment· given to oratory-priests, which they
deserve.

6ῒΙῙ Pravo corde machinatur malum. The root of all intrigues is
sectarian feeling. They consider only their sect's advantage, and thus
sin more grievously as a body than so many separate individuals.
Christ lived with His Apostles, but He knew whom to choose and
how to instruct them; and they were afterwards dispersed. The Friars
are as bad as the endowed monks. Their union crushes even the most
legitimate opposition, for they employ every influence to gain their
point. And all are responsible sor this. Some good men remain
amongst them; others fly in despair, but {f taken are put to death
or in prison for life. A curious quotation follows, comparing the
Friars to wild geese; then comes an urgent appeal to Wyclif's friends
amongst them to help him in exposing the others.

71¹¹ Et omni tempore jurgia seminat. Wyclif accuses them of
sowing divisions in their own order, wars throughout Christendom7
and dissensions in the Church; he attempts to prove the latter point
from history. They do good, but also harm3 and we know by faith
and God’s grace that the latter exceeds the former. -—- All this has no
bearing upon some Friars who are Wyclif’s most dear sons (p. 44);
but if any do what is here denounced, it is the Holy Spirit‚ not
Wyclif‚ that calls them by the name of apostates. All this has been
said for the good of the Chumh, and of the Friars themselves.

Ch. 111. Though the Eucharistic debates are, so far as I can
see, independent of each other, it is yet not impossible to introduce a
little order amongst them by classifying thern as they stand. The
first, beginning with Ch, III and ending at the close of Ch. Vll, is
so to speak a general attack upon the then universally received theory
of the Eucharist. The second, beginning with the VIIIth Cb. aud
ending with the end of the IX¹¹17 deals specially with the multiplicatiori
of Christ’s body in the Eucharist. The third (Ch. X) is an enquiry
into the essence or ‘quiddity' of the Sacrament. The fourth (Chs, XI
