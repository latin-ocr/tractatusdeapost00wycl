XIV INTRODUCTION.

to XV) is a more detailed attack on the accident-theory: going through
many classes of accidents, Wyclif asserts that none can be absolute
in the sense required. Chapters XV and XVI seem to be a written
reply to some treatise or treatises composed against him. He carefully
goes over all the authorities quoted by his adversaries, explains their
meaning agreeably to his own views, and adds several very important
remarks concerning his doctrine. Ch. XVII is principally a historical
review of the institution of the Mass. Of course there is not a single
chapter in which something extrinsical, either concerning the Friars,
Church temporalities, or the power of the Pope, does not occur,
but as I said before, unless something particularly worthy of notice
comes to hand, I am obliged to confine myself to the main question
and to overlook repetitions.

It is necessary to offer a few remarks as to the dogma of
Transsubstantiation, and the philosophical theories connected therewith
in the Catholic Church. Scholastic theologians were from the beginning
in face of a universal belief in the real presence of Christ's Body in
the Holy Eucharist; and that belief was borne out by the written tra-
dition, both ofthe Fathers, ofthe Apostle Paul, and of the Gospels thern-
selves. Here a difficulty occurred: the bread seemed to remain, assuredly3
but if it remained really, how could Christ's body be really there?
Nothing can be where it was not before, unless by a change of place,
or by conversion of something else into itself.1 Therefore, as Christ
does not leave Heaven, the bread itself, remaining to all the senses
as it was before, is changed into Christ's body3 the substance, or as
we might perhaps call it, the nomnenon alone is changed, all the
plzenomena are what they were (Aq. S. Th. qu. 75, art. 2). This is
a fresh mystery, which also requires to be explained: for how can
appearances possibly exist, without anything that appears?

There is here a split amongst Catholic philosophers. The
Scholastics answered the question thus: Every accident, while belonging
to the substance, possesses a certain amount of reality, of entity‚
which is different from the latter3 a bent finger being really different
from a finger that is straight, that which makes the difference must

¹ This axiom Wyclif (p. 186, l. 2) is constrained to call heretical; for it is
evidently in contradiction with his system, as we shall see.
